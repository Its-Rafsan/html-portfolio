<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Mushiur Rahman, a student of Northern University Bangladesh.<br />
I’m passionate about technology and programming — always curious, always learning.</p>

<p>In my free time, you’ll usually find me playing video games like Valorant and Clash of Clans.
Gaming keeps me sharp, programming keeps me focused, and both keep me motivated to improve every day.</p>

<p>I’m a simple person with big goals, always trying to level up in life just like in the games I love.</p>
